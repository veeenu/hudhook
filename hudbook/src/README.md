# Introduction

`hudhook` allows you to create injectable DLLs that seamlessly hook into the rendering loop of
applications and draw an overlay UI. This way, you can control the application's state, display
relevant information, or do whatever it is you would like to do every time a frame is displayed
by the rendering engine.

At the moment, the only UI toolkit supported is `dear imgui`, but there are plans to support
`egui` in the future for a 100% Rust development experience.

`hudhook` currently supports rendering on top of DirectX 9, DirectX 11, DirectX 12, and OpenGL 3.
If the application you chose to target uses one of these engines, `hudhook` can get in there and
draw stuff for you!

The way this is done is by [detouring] calls to rendering functions, such as
`IDXGISwapChain::Present`, and introduce custom logic and draw calls before yielding the control
back to the host application.

In this book, you will be guided through creating a hookable library and injecting it into a
[sample DirectX 12 application](samples).
